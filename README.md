⛔️ Sorry! After a recent deprecation to existing endpoints in [COVID19India API](https://data.covid19india.org/#announcement) data is broken and the app needs a re-work. I currently do not have enough bandwidth to work on this. If anyone is interested, please feel free to take up this project. I will get back to this after a while. Thank You!
